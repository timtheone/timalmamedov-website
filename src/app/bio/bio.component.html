      <h4>Hi, my name is Timur Almamedov. Nice to meet you.</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Iâ€™ve always had passion for technology,and i like creating stuff. I am fairly new to the game, but i am very passionate about web development. Along with my continious self-education, I finished Codefactory coding school in Vienna,and Le wagon bootcamp in Brussels. I like playing guitar, and my favourite color is #8C43FF, and believe me, i am trying not to use it everywhere.</p>
